# Golden Rules

1.  **Communication Protocol**
    - Chat interaction with the user: **Russian**.
    - Code, comments, commit messages, and branch names: **English ONLY**.

2.  **Branch Integrity**
    - The `main` and `develop` branches are protected. They MUST NOT be deleted or force-pushed to. All merges into them must be via Pull Requests.

3.  **Component Generation**
    - ALL new React components MUST be scaffolded using the `bun hygen component new --name ComponentName` command. Do not create component files manually.

4.  **Styling Constraints**
    - Custom CSS files (`.css`), CSS Modules (`.module.css`), or inline `<style>` tags are STRICTLY FORBIDDEN.
    - All styling MUST be achieved using **Tailwind CSS 4** utility classes and pre-built **Shadcn/ui** components.

5.  **Documentation Policy**
    - Code should be self-documenting. AVOID creating excessive documentation (e.g., long TSDoc blocks for simple functions).
    - Adhere strictly to the existing project folder structure for organization. Do not create new top-level directories without explicit permission.
